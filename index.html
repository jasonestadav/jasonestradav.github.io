Do this in iterations, where each student must contribute something that includes:
A comment with purpose of new code and mention of the source or inspiration for added code, and the actual new code.
Edited code should also be commented on to detail changes.
Then the group commits the changes and pushes them to GitHub with proper commit comments.-->

    <p>I'm the kind of guy that likes to draw, play music, and hang out with my cat.<br>
    During quarantine, I did pretty much all of those things. When I was still at school, I<br>
    never had enough time in the day to draw or play music. For the past two months, I was able<br>
    to make my time for myself while also managing to juggle schoolwork on the side.</p>
